# Backup Program
This repository contains a shell script and is used to backup files.

# About
When dealing with text-based files (eg. codes, notes, etc.), it is very important for us to assure the security of the data. This program offers an automatic backup to all your files in **current directory** after each 10 minutes by default.

# Editor
Vim v7.4.8056

# Voice Usage
This software uses "say" command to generate verbal information. The first reason of this design is for accessibility concerns. The second reason is that if the backup program runs in the background, it is a good way for the program to notify the users about the progress of backup verbally, which strengthens their control about the backup process.

# Software Log
**The log of this software contains 3 lines of information.**

 1. Which backup it is
 2. What time it is when the backup is conducted.
 3. How many files are copied in this backup.
